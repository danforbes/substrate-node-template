# Sydney - Decentralized / Self-Sovereign Identity with Substrate

The purpose of this project is to explore decentralized identity (DID) on Substrate-based chains in
order to learn and educate. The name is a reference to the acronym SSID, which is used to refer to
the concept of self-sovereign identity üê®

## Background

The [Decentralized Identifier specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) is maintained by the
[World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/). It describes a new way for people to interact with
each other and with centers of trust (like government agencies, educational institutes, and social
networks). In order to achieve this goal, the DID specification depends on the permissionless,
decentralized storage capabilities of a blockchain. According to the charter of the
[Decentralized Identifier Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/09/did-wg-charter.html), DID
protocols enable the next-generation of digital identity management, like
[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.io/).
Even large enterprises like Microsoft are
[investigating](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2DjfY) applications of
decentralized identity.

This project is just to learn and experiment. If you want to see what production-grade decentralized
identity on Substrate looks like, check out [Dock](https://www.dock.io/) and
